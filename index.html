										<h3>Initial post</h3>
										<p>In the paper Compromising a Medical Mannequin (Glisson et al., 2015) we are introduced to different vulnerabilities that IoT devices can have in the medical field as well as what can those vulnerabilities cause when exploited. The report presented the outcome of such vulnerabilities can vary from data leakage, device behaviour rewriting and even physical harm of the patient. The report also demonstrated how easy it is to gain access to some of these devices by using different methods such as Brute Force attacks as well as delian of service.</p>
										<p>The initial case of brute force attack was achieved by using a BlackTrack CD which is a Linux distribution that contains a variety of exploitation tools for different purposes.  In this particular case “airman” and “reaver” was used to gain access to the wireless network. This can be avoided by using an authentication server for wireless access such as 802.1x/WPA-Enterprise instead of preshared key along side a strong wireless authentication protocol. (Spalter, 2021)
										</p><p>Another case that was presented in the paper was a brute force attack to also gain access to the wireless network using a different strategy. This can also be mitigated by creating strong authentication profiles as well as a separated authentication server for network access.
										</p><p>Finally the denial of service attack was performed to affect device availability using tools from the same linux distribution. Denial of service can be mitigated using a modern firewall as it is the case with Palo Alto NGFW (next generation firewall) that can observe traffic behaviour and stop certain actors from executing such exploitations. (Getting a Handle on DDoS, 2021)
										</p><p>As a side note, currently working for a Pharma Company specifically to mitigate vulnerabilities in the OT (operation techonlogy) environment, I can see how important these devices are for the well being of many patients. I personally believe that we should be always ahead of the technological curve when trying to protect such devices from vulnerabilities.

										<dt>Group 2 : Results of basic scans of groups 3 website</dt>
										<p>IGroup 3 provided us with their website information (https://dev8773.d2d6ymu8mykhhu.amplifyapp.com/) to do some basic scanning. Since we are residing at different locations (Germany, Netherlands and Nigeria) we decided that each member carries out their own scanning, so we can compare the effect of location and time zones.
										</p>
										<p>Nils did his scanning from Düsseldorf, Germany and could reach the website in 3 hops using tracert. The biggest delay hereby was the third hop with 14ms.This latency could be caused by distance (as the website server is in the US, hosted by Amazon) or by bandwidth limitations. The ping resulted Minimum = 87ms, Maximum = 94ms, Middle= 90ms. There was no detectable MX record. A whois search (https://whois.domaintools.com/) showed that most information was redacted for privacy.
										</p><p>Haroun carried out his scanning from Lagos, Nigeria and was successful in reaching the website in 30 hops using traceroute. The most significant delay in this exercise was the 30th hop at 133.44ms. There was no MX record identified## .										</p><p>Finally the denial of service attack was performed to affect device availability using tools from the same linux distribution. Denial of service can be mitigated using a modern firewall as it is the case with Palo Alto NGFW (next generation firewall) that can observe traffic behaviour and stop certain actors from executing such exploitations. (Getting a Handle on DDoS, 2021)
										</p><p>Adrian did a scan from the Netherlands and in this particular example had 17 hops till the destination. That is due to the fact  the website is hosted in AWS and using cloud front to deliver the website to different regions efficiently. CloudFront is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) service that speeds up distribution of your website using own amazon datacenter infrastructure from edge locations. (What is Amazon CloudFront? - Amazon CloudFront, 2021). Due to this fact the results are different depending where the scanning is done. Destination IP address is also different depending on the location the scanning is being done due to the same reason as mentioned above. CloudFront has multiple endpoints at edge location in amazon infrastructure thus having different destination IPs for this particular FQDN (fully qualified domain name). We have also noticed multiple A records entries for the website and this is also due to CloudFront where multiple entries are used for redundancy purposes. Due to privacy regulations we can see that the contact registered for this domain is general as well as no MX entries present due to the fact that the domain does not serve mail purposes.

										<h3>Initial post</h3>
										<p><b>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</b></p>
										<p>The aspect I chose to cover is the right to be forgotten which is a very interesting one from my perspective. Is in fact something we should all be able to exercise in cases where the information about us online is not controlled by us and inaccurate.
										</p><p><b>How was it resolved?</b>
										</p><p>In this particular case the issue was resolved by requesting the search engine operator to remove all the links that were pointing to the user’s inaccurate data over the internet. Request that the search engine provider complied with
										</p><p><b>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</b>
										</p><p>Firstly I would make sure that all the information about the user is accurate. It’s easy and faster to instruct a script to create automating indexing of web pages without particular background checks but having accurate and appropriate data is in fact beneficial not only for the user the data is about but also for the reader.
